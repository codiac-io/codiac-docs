# Where Does Codiac Fit In?

## The Burden of Tool-chaining

The software industry has witnessed an explosion of Microframeworks, and open sourced tooling which, though powerful and accessible, means a developer’s finite hour-by-hour workflow is now riddled with more decisions, more research, and more tool-chaining than ever before.


## Containerization

In walks the revolution of containerized clustering, which provides scalability, portability, and performance.  Though it prevents the vendor-locking that a serverless function implementation would impose, a containerized SDLC (Software Development Life Cycle) has the potential to be painfully complex, time consuming to your best people, and expensive.

## Trial and Error is for the Rich

Today’s software investments begin with tough decisions of how. Decisions that leave their impact well after the money is spent. These imperatives are driving companies into unfamiliar, unforgiving terrain, and most are making large investments in the unsustainable strategy of  trial and error.

## Outsource The Madness

Codiac enables you to outsource this effort to a (SaaS) solution that is backed by a team of seasoned experts.  It is our sole purpose to integrate these tools into a proven effective process, and get your applications into containers and out to the cluster without the large capital investment.
