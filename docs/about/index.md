## So What is Codiac?

Safely get your company into Kubernetes reliably and repeatably.  

Cloud Simple.

The process of getting software to market has been sidelining the ability to write good software.

In response, [Codiac](http://codiac.io) is an integration tool designed to streamline the development experience, DevOps pipelines, and runtime oversight of your projects.  Its ability to remember what you tell it seamlessly integrates your major workflow tools into a single collaborative **CLI** and **suite**.



<!--  KEEP THIS FOR LATER 
 Codiac acts as a highly efficient workflow interface from development through runtime. Your team is thereby endowed with the evolutionary advantage of having full enterprise context embued in all steps of your SDLC (Software Development Life Cycle).

(What slows us down (makes things complicated) is not having state.) 
We work in disparate systems  statically, 
change, environment, config, user-tenant, acc
so then
...systems that dont know about the other things.  We gthen have to ties them togather, and thus, the lions share of our time is spent toolchaining, fixing human error, or repeating ourselves in every task.
and its up to use to tie them together beacuase they dont have ent context and state.


We work in disparate systems, so it's been up to each of us to tie all these systems together.  This workflow is missing ent context and state.

Codiac is bringing these missing layers of enterprise context and state into to the development, deployment, and runtime management of your projects.

Our proprietery development state management finally gives context to all your companies components as a whole

<!-- KEEP THIS PARAGRAPH 
Most products provide a specific function, the "what", and their interface for doing so, the "how", is, by definition, secondary (*and often that can be quite an understatement*).  Unlike such products, the primary purpose of Codiac is to make you a more effective and potent contributor ***while using*** those other products.  That is, the "how" is actually first.  So Codiac is, in fact, the only part of your product suite that is dedicated ***primarily*** to enhancing how efficiently you produce.

As such, context and user experience are actually THE primary directives, around which the rest of the suite is conceived.

As mentioned above, Codiac puts forth three tiers for maintaining projects in Kubernetes:  

* [Asset Development](./asset-dev.md)

* [DevOps and Pipelines](./devops.md)

* [Runtime Management](runtime-mgmt.md)
