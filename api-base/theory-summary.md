# Theory: Smart defaults, Decoupling, Extensibility, and COTN (Code Only The Nuance)

## Let's Leverage our Brains
We are well into the 21st century and are you ***still*** coding the obvious?  Do you wonder why this awesome career path sometimes feels like pure drudgery?  Monotony and lack of discovery are often the culprits (*and yes, so is a boring manager*).  

We are born to discover and create. 

We literally lose that opportunity on an hourly basis by being burdened to code and maintain basic, obvious repetitive things.  And from the standpoint of productivity, well, that's quite simply a waste.

MongoDb and crud endpoints are a good example: Let's say you do use MongoDb on most API projects (*NOTE: you dont HAVE to use MongoDb, this is just an example to make a point*).  
* Do you have to constantly specify Mongo?  Every time?  
* Do you have to declare each and every crud endpoint?  
* How much time are you putting into MongoDb dealing with basic entity relationships?
* Do you have to write each and every data access method?  
* Do you have to ensure standards compliance for each endpoint?
* Do you have to go do all this again and write a new endpoint for every variation of output needed by the consumer?

My god, man, how many hours, days, or even months are you into this project before you do anything unique?  So far, all you've done is attempt to meet the status quo.  And honestly now, did you even get that far?  Did you even hit ALL your conventions and standards on all your endpoints?.  

Here's a question: Who else could build what you just did?  Oh yeah, **e v e r y o n e**.  That's why its called the status quo.  And when you've just spent the predominant amount of your time trying to reach the status quo, don't you feel a slight chill?  You should, because:

    That's your lack-of-ability-to-demonstrate-what-you're-worth 
    creeping up on you.  

A business stakeholder should feel the same chill of oppotunity cost in terms of product evolution, cost, and competitive advantage. 

This system exists for us to reallocate that wasted time toward the unique part.  If APIs are part science and part art, we can say that this system handles more of the science, allowing you time for more art.  In other words, 

***This system was built to maximize our potential.***

## Yeah, it does the busywork, I get it.  But what about it?

Thus, you will be standing on the backs of powerful commands, smart defaults, layered extensibility, modular design patterns, built-in standards, all geared toward the basic premise of following your intuition and enabling you to Code Only The Nuance ([COTN](https://youtu.be/uLr0v9MyGgM?t=14)).
